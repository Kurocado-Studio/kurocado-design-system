# TurboRepo


## Context

Our project requires a robust solution to manage a monorepo setup that consolidates various applications and shared resources. We need a tool that simplifies dependency management, streamlines workflows, and enhances collaboration across teams. The key requirements include efficient build caching, scalable architecture, and a seamless developer experience. After evaluating several options, we focused on Turborepo due to its specific features and community support.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt Turborepo for our monorepo setup. Turborepo offers several compelling features:

1. **Efficient Build Caching:** Turborepo provides intelligent caching mechanisms that save time in building and testing. It caches the outputs of tasks across our CI/CD pipelines, reducing build times significantly.

2. **Scalable Architecture:** It is designed to handle large-scale monorepos, making it a suitable choice as our project grows. Turborepo ensures that adding more packages and apps won't degrade performance.

3. **Optimized Task Execution:** Turborepo optimizes the execution of tasks by only rebuilding what is necessary. This incremental build approach is crucial for large codebases with multiple interdependent components.

4. **Simplified Workflow:** It offers a unified approach to managing tasks, dependencies, and configurations across the monorepo, streamlining our development workflow.

5. **Strong Community and Support:** Being widely adopted in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems, Turborepo has a strong community presence. This ensures better support, continuous updates, and a larger pool of resources and documentation.

## Consequences

1. **Learning Curve:** There will be an initial learning curve for the team to adapt to Turborepo's way of managing the monorepo.

2. **Dependency on Turborepo's Ecosystem:** Our build and deployment processes will be closely tied to Turborepo's ecosystem, which could be a potential risk if the tool's development stalls or if it doesn't adapt to future needs.

3. **Improved Build Times:** We anticipate a significant reduction in build and test times, leading to increased developer productivity.

4. **Better Collaboration:** With a more streamlined and efficient workflow, team collaboration is expected to improve, especially when working on interdependent parts of the monorepo.

5. **Scalability for Future Growth:** Choosing Turborepo positions us well for scaling our project in the future, with its ability to efficiently handle large and complex monorepos.
