# Domain-Driven Design

## Context

The rapidly evolving landscape of web technologies, particularly in the JavaScript ecosystem, presents significant challenges in maintaining a coherent and business-aligned design system. React, as a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offers a powerful foundation but requires a robust architectural approach to ensure that the design system remains resilient, maintainable, and closely aligned with business objectives. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) offers a methodology that emphasizes a deep understanding of the business domain, modularity, and a shared ubiquitous language across teams, which seems particularly suited to address these challenges in a React environment.

## Decision

We propose to adopt Domain-Driven Design principles as the core architectural approach for structuring our design system in React. This decision is based on the following considerations:

1. **Focus on Business Logic**: Align React components and structures with business needs and logic, ensuring intuitive and relevant development.
2. **Modularity and Reusability**: Implement bounded contexts from DDD as modular and reusable React components, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
3. **Consistent Language Across Teams**: Use DDD’s ubiquitous language to ensure common understanding across developers, designers, and business analysts.
4. **Robust and Flexible Structure**: Leverage DDD to handle complex business logic and rules, reflecting them in the React design system for flexibility and intuitive mapping.
5. **Strategic Design Integration**: Apply DDD’s strategic thinking to determine component interactions and compositions in the React design system.
6. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Separate domain logic from application and infrastructure logic, enhancing maintainability and scalability in the React context.
7. **Facilitates Collaboration and Evolution**: Embrace DDD’s approach to continuous learning and evolving models in the development and maintenance of the design system.
8. **Enhanced Testability**: Structure components to be easily testable, focusing on their domain-specific functionality.

## Consequences

1. **Enhanced Alignment with Business Goals**: The design system will be more closely aligned with the business domain, ensuring relevance and effectiveness.
2. **Improved Communication and Collaboration**: A shared language and modular approach will facilitate better communication and collaboration across teams.
3. **Increased System Resilience**: The design system will be more adaptable to changes in technology and business requirements, owing to its focus on the business domain and modularity.
4. **Potential Learning Curve**: There might be a learning curve associated with adopting DDD principles, especially for team members unfamiliar with this approach.
5. **Need for Continuous Refactoring**: The system will require ongoing refactoring and adaptation to new requirements and technologies, in line with DDD principles.
6. **Possible Initial Overhead**: Initially, implementing DDD in the React design system might introduce some overhead in terms of planning and restructuring existing components.
