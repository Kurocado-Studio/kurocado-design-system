# RFC 2023-12-01 AnimationClient

| Status | Accepted |
|:-------|:---------|

## Background

- [See Framer Motion for animation decision](002-Framer-Motion.md)

## Design Proposal

The integration of AnimationClient with Framer Motion aims to enhance our
application's user interface with fluid and responsive animations. Framer Motion
is a React library that simplifies the process of creating animations and allows
for more dynamic and engaging UIs. The implementation strategy is as follows:

1. **Importing Framer Motion**: Start by importing Framer Motion components such
   as `motion`. This library provides a powerful yet straightforward way to
   implement animations in React applications.

2. **Defining Animation Parameters**: Utilize Framer Motion's `animate`,
   `initial`, and `exit` properties to define how elements should animate in,
   stay, and animate out.

3. **Leveraging Motion Values**: Use Framer Motion's motion values to create
   more complex animations and transitions. Motion values can be used to
   interpolate values, track the state of animations, or react to user input.

4. **Integrating with Gestures**: Implement gesture animations, such as drag or
   hover effects, using Framer Motion's gesture handlers. This allows for
   interactive and intuitive UI elements.

5. **Optimizing for Performance**: Utilize Framer Motion's features like
   `AnimatePresence` for optimized mounting and unmounting animations, ensuring
   minimal performance impact.

**Example in Practice**: An interactive card component that scales up on hover
and has a smooth fade-in effect when it enters the viewport. This card can be
implemented using the `motion.div` component with appropriate `hover` and
`initial` properties.

**The Role of Framer Motion in Development**: Framer Motion simplifies the
process of adding animations to a React application, making it easier for
developers to create engaging and interactive UIs without extensive animation
knowledge.

      - Widely supported across all modern browsers.
      - Simple animations can be implemented quickly.
   - **Cons**:
      - Limited in complexity and control compared to JavaScript-based solutions.
      - Requires additional effort to synchronize with Reacts lifecycle and
        state.
   - **Analysis**: While CSS animations are efficient for simpler tasks, they
     lack the dynamic interaction capabilities and integration ease that Framer
     Motion offers with React components.

2. **React Spring**:

   - **Pros**:
      - Provides a more natural physics-based approach to animations.
      - Supports a wide range of animations and transitions.
      - Good integration with React's component model.

      - Configuration can be complex for elaborate animations.
   - **Analysis**: React Spring is a strong contender with its physics-based
     system, offering realistic animations. However, Framer Motion's simpler API
     and ease of use for a broad range of animations make it more suitable for
     our diverse project needs.

3. **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)**:

   - **Pros**:
      - Extremely powerful and versatile, suitable for complex animations.
      - High performance and browser compatibility.
      - Large community and extensive documentation.
   - **Cons**:
      - Overhead of learning and integrating another external library.
      - Some advanced features are behind a paid license.

     introduces additional complexity and potential costs. Framer Motion
     provides sufficient capabilities for our needs, with a more straightforward
     integration path for React.

4. **React Motion**:

   - **Pros**:
      - Physics-based animation library, offering realistic motion.
      - Integrates well with React's component lifecycle.
   - **Cons**:
      - Less intuitive API compared to other libraries.
      - Somewhat limited in features and community support compared to Framer
        Motion.
   - **Analysis**: React Motion is a decent option but falls short in ease of
     use and the breadth of features that Framer Motion excels in.

5. **Velocity.js**:
   - **Pros**:
      - High performance and feature-rich.
      - Works outside the React ecosystem as well.
   - **Cons**:
      - Requires manual handling to integrate with React's state and component
        lifecycle.
