## Design Proposal

This is the central part of the document, where you explain your proposal. Discuss the proposed design, its integration with existing systems, key components, and their interactions. If you have multiple alternatives, use sub-sections for each idea, listing the pros and cons.

## Detailed Design Proposal

Elaborate on the important details of your design that are critical to understanding the proposal. Include technical specifics, data flow diagrams, API descriptions, pseudocode, and architectural diagrams.

## User Stories

| Task | User Story |

## Alternatives Considered

- Discuss the relative merits of alternatives to your proposal, including a comprehensive analysis of competing approaches and reasons for preferring your design.

## Performance Implications

- Address any expected performance impacts (speed, memory usage, etc.), how you will confirm these, and plans for testing performance. Describe any benchmarks or metrics to be used.

## Dependencies

- Detail any new dependencies introduced by your proposal, their impact on other parts of the system, and how these dependencies have been identified and managed.

## Engineering Impact

- Discuss the impact on the engineering process, including development, testing, and maintenance. Identify who will maintain the code and how it will be integrated and tested within the existing system.

## Tutorials and Examples

- Provide tutorials or examples showing how your proposal will be used. This should include end-to-end examples that demonstrate the usage of new features in practical scenarios. Even though the feature is not implemented yet, draft the examples as if they are documentation for the new feature, making them understandable for users.
