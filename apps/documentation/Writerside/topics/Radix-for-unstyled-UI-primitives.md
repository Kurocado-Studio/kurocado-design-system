# Radix UI for Component Development

## Context

In the evolving landscape of web development, the demand for building
accessible, customizable, and maintainable UI components is ever-increasing.
Radix UI, a low-level UI component library, has emerged as a prominent solution
in this domain. Our team conducted a thorough evaluation of various UI component
libraries, taking into account the latest industry trends and the specific
requirements of our projects.

## Decision

We have chosen Radix UI as our primary UI component library. This decision is
founded on multiple key factors:

1. **Accessibility**: Radix UI places a strong emphasis on accessibility,
   adhering to WAI-ARIA standards. This ensures our UI components are accessible
   to all users, including those with disabilities.

2. **Customization and Flexibility**: Unlike many component libraries that
   dictate styling, Radix UI provides unstyled, low-level components. This
   allows us to apply our design system seamlessly and ensures that our UI is
   consistent with our brand's aesthetic.

3. **Developer Experience**: Radix UI offers a straightforward API and
   comprehensive documentation, making it easy for developers to implement
   complex UI components.

4. **Focus on Core Functionality**: By offering a suite of unstyled primitives,
   Radix UI allows us to focus on core functionality and interaction patterns,
   reducing the time spent on building and testing these aspects from scratch.

5. **Community and Support**: Radix UI has an active community and is backed by
   a team dedicated to its development and maintenance, ensuring it stays
   up-to-date with modern web standards and practices.

6. **Scalability and Performance**: Designed with performance in mind, Radix UI
   components are lightweight and efficient, contributing positively to the
   overall performance of our applications.

## Consequences

1. **Learning Curve**: Developers may need time to adapt to the unstyled nature
   of Radix UI and understand how to integrate it with our styling solutions.

2. **Design Coordination**: Given its unstyled nature, close coordination
   between designers and developers will be essential to ensure that components
   align with our design system.

3. **Increased Development Responsibility**: While Radix UI handles
   accessibility and functionality, the responsibility for styling and
   additional behavior rests with our team, requiring a well-thought-out
   approach to styling and state management.

4. **Enhanced Customization Capability**: Radix UI's architecture provides us
   with the flexibility to create highly customized UI components that can cater
   to specific project requirements.

5. **Long-term Maintainability**: Adopting Radix UI aligns with our long-term
   goal of building sustainable and maintainable UI components that can evolve
   with our projects' needs.

This decision to adopt Radix UI underlines our commitment to building
high-quality, accessible, and customizable user interfaces while being mindful
of the challenges and learning opportunities it presents.
