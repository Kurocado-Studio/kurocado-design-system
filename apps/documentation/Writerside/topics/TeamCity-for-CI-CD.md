# TeamCity for CI/CD

## Context

In the process of enhancing our software development lifecycle, the need for a robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) solution has become paramount. While we have JetBrains IDE licensing, JetBrains Space, and JetBrains YouTrack in our technology stack, the decision to choose a CI/CD tool should be based on broader criteria. JetBrains TeamCity is under consideration as a potential CI/CD solution. The decision needs to be informed by its capabilities, performance, and how it aligns with our organizational and technical needs, beyond just its integration with other JetBrains products.

## Decision

We propose to adopt JetBrains TeamCity as our primary CI/CD tool. This decision is based on several key factors beyond existing JetBrains ecosystem integrations:

1. **Advanced Build Management and Customization**: TeamCity offers sophisticated build management features, including customizable build pipelines, a wide range of supported languages and technologies, and detailed build history and logs.

2. **Scalability and Reliability**: The tool has a proven track record for handling large-scale projects and numerous concurrent builds, ensuring reliability and scalability as our project grows.

3. **Strong Version Control System (VCS) Integration**: TeamCity offers robust integration with various version control systems, enabling efficient code management and automated build triggering from VCS changes.

4. **Comprehensive Testing and Reporting Tools**: TeamCity includes powerful testing and reporting tools, providing detailed insights into build successes and failures, which is essential for maintaining high code quality.

## Consequences

1. **Improved CI/CD Processes**: Adopting TeamCity is expected to streamline and enhance our CI/CD processes, leading to increased efficiency and faster time-to-market for our software products.

2. **Increased Infrastructure Overhead**: Implementing and maintaining TeamCity, especially for large-scale operations, may increase our infrastructure overhead in terms of resources and management.

3. **Dependency on a Single Vendor**: Choosing TeamCity further deepens our reliance on JetBrains products, which might pose risks in terms of vendor lock-in and flexibility in the future.
